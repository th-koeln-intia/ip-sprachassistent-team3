# Different ways of setting up the VA 

## A user's POV

### WLAN

You connect the VA with your computer. Upon booting it up, an HTML page appears. On this page, you are able to enter your WiFi information and register new ZigBee compatible lights via their topic. Additionally, after researching correct webstream URLs, you can add them as well for a greater variety of radio stations than the default ones.
