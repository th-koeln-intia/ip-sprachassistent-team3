# Getting the Weather report

We have chosen the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) based on research done by fellow students working on as similar project but with a different stack. [Click here](https://ip-team4.intia.de/) to be forwarded to their documentation.

You will need to register on their [website](https://openweathermap.org/) for a free API key. They offer subscription-models for a wider range of functions if you are interested, but the free version is enough for us. 

## Flow features
- The current temperature in a specific city, humidity and details regarding whether it is sunny or cloudy
- Time of sunset and sunrise
- The weather forecast for the next 7 days
