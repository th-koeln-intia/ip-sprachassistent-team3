# Proof Of Concept

We have decided on a little morning routine as our proof of concept, i. e. as proof that our voice assistant works.

You just say, "Apollo, guten Morgen."

The VA then performs the following tasks.

- It greets you back, saying "Guten Morgen!"
- Then it tells you what the weather is going to be like today
- After, it starts playing the radio for you

## Your morning routine
