# Prerequisites

- SSH Client
  - Putty
  - Windows 10 has its own OpenSSH feature

If you plan on using the Pi headless like we have, you need to have a SSH client of some form installed on your PC. [Here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/ssh/) (under point 3) you can find tutorials on how and what client to use for your specific OS.

- File Manager is nice to have
  - for a better Overview of filesystem within Pi
